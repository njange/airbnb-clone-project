# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. This project focuses on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security, enabling developers to build a scalable and secure web application.

## Project Goals
- Develop a scalable backend architecture.
- Implement secure and efficient APIs.
- Design a relational database structure.
- Integrate modern tools and technologies for CI/CD and deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Django**: A web framework for building RESTful APIs and backend logic, enabling rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **MySQL**: A relational database for storing and managing application data, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need, improving performance and flexibility.
- **Docker**: A tool for containerization, providing consistent development and deployment environments across different systems.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD platform for automating testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient and error-free development workflows.

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic, creating APIs, and ensuring the backend architecture is scalable and efficient.
- **Database Administrator**: Manages the database design, ensures data integrity, and optimizes database performance for the application.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines, manages containerization using Docker, and ensures smooth deployment processes.
- **API Security Specialist**: Focuses on implementing authentication, authorization, and other security measures to protect user data and secure transactions.
- **Project Manager**: Oversees the project timeline, coordinates between team members, and ensures that the project goals are met on schedule.
